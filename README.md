# AnyWebView

Any WebView is OK!

<img src=".github/webviews.jpg" width="720"/>

Android Framework should be selected in LSPosed.

A webview app must be installed for all users (or in all spaces) to be selectable. Maybe deleting redundant users is alternative.
adb command:

Get USER_ID list:

`adb shell pm list users`

Each user entry is as follow: UserInfo{USER_ID:USERNAME:INT} , USER_ID 0 is the main user.

Install apk for specific USER_ID:

`adb install --user USER_ID PATH_TO_APK`

or

`adb shell pm install-existing --user USER_ID PACKAGE.NAME.OF.APK` (for apks already installed for one user)

or

`adb push PATH_TO_APK PATH_TO_APK_IN_PHONE` (copy an apk file to phone from pc)

`adb shell pm install --user USER_ID PATH_TO_APK_IN_PHONE`

Delete a user (be careful, you may lose important data):

`adb shell pm remove-user USER_ID`

All the `adb shell pm ...` commands above can be run in an Android terminal simulator(root access granted) as `pm ...`

Reboot to take effect.
